## 📝 Complete 5-Minute Pitch Script

---

**[0:00 - 0:30] PAGE 1: COVER - Opening Statement (Emotional Anchor)**

---

Good morning. My name is Patrick Ma.

I want to start with a question: **What if goodbye didn't have to mean forever?**

*Every 10 seconds, somewhere in the world, someone loses someone irreplaceable.*

A parent. A child. A partner.

I lived through this. When my grandfather passed away, I realized something devastating: I would never hear his voice again. I'd never ask him for advice. I'd never know the stories he didn't have time to tell my children.

All his wisdom, all his love—*gone.*

That moment changed everything for me.

I started thinking: What if we could use AI to preserve not just his memories, but his *presence*? What if my kids could still talk to him? What if he could still answer their questions?

**That's Soma.**

Soma is not a storage app. Soma is not a chatbot. **Soma is the bridge between memory and presence.**

Using a lifetime of photos, emails, voice recordings, and life experiences, Soma creates a digital person who *thinks, speaks, and responds like the person you love.*

When they're gone, Soma ensures they can still be *present.*

*Let's build the future where memories never fade.*

---

**[0:30 - 1:00] PAGE 2: PROBLEM - Why This Matters (Building Urgency)**

---

Let me give you the numbers:

**Globally, 300 million people lose someone irreplaceable every year.**

In the United States alone, it's 2.7 million deaths annually.

But these numbers don't tell the real story.

What do people actually face after losing someone?

*Families are left with 10,000 photos scattered across cloud storage.*  
*Voice messages too painful to delete, but too painful to hear.*  
*Stories that will never be told to grandchildren.*  
*And silence. So much silence.*

The current solutions? They all fail.

Traditional memorials—gravestones, urns—they mark *absence*, not presence. You can't interact with them. You can't ask them questions.

Generic AI chatbots? Completely impersonal. They don't know who your loved one was. They have no personality. They're cold.

Digital photo galleries? Static. Lifeless. Just data.

**There's a massive gap in the market.** A $50 billion gap.

And the reason it exists is simple: **No one has cracked how to authentically resurrect someone's presence through technology.**

Until now.

---

**[1:00 - 1:30] PAGE 3: MARKET - Why Now? (Data Credibility)**

---

Let me be direct about the opportunity:

**This is a $50 billion market.**

Here's the math:
- 2.7 million Americans die every year
- Average family spends $8,000 on memorials and grief services
- That's $21.6 billion *just in the US*
- Globally, it's over $50 billion

But that's just the starting number.

You've got 68 million Americans without proper estate plans. And right now, something unprecedented is happening:

**Millennials and Gen X are losing their parents.**

These aren't people afraid of technology. They *grew up* with it. They're comfortable with AI. They're tech-native. And now they're asking: "How do I preserve mom's memory in the digital age?"

Plus, you have demographic tailwinds:
- COVID normalized virtual funerals (87% adoption rate)
- Baby Boomers are entering their final years (deaths will jump from 2.7M to 3.3M annually by 2030)
- Digital asset inheritance is entering legal frameworks in California, New York, and across Europe

The window is open. AI is finally good enough. Society is ready. **This is the right moment.**

And here's the thing: **No competitor has occupied this market.**

HereAfter has 50K users, but their technology is primitive—just scripted Q&A.  
Eternime raised millions and never shipped a product.  
StoryFile costs $5,000+ and requires professional filming.

**We can own this category.**

---

**[1:30 - 2:00] PAGE 4-5: SOLUTION - How It Works (Core Experience)**

---

Soma does three fundamental things:

**First: Authentic Dialogue.**

You ask: "Mom, what was your favorite meal I ever made?"

Soma responds—using your mom's voice, your mom's vocabulary, your mom's personality:

*"Your lasagna. Remember my birthday last September? You spent all afternoon making it from scratch. You told me 'This tastes like home.' I've never forgotten that day."*

Here's what makes this different from a chatbot: **Every single response cites the memories it's based on.** Zero hallucination. Complete traceability.

**Second: Family Collaboration.**

One person's memories are incomplete. But imagine:

Your sister uploads home videos and mom's recipes.  
Your brother uploads voicemails he saved from 2019.  
Your dad uploads 40 years of family photos.

Suddenly, the AI doesn't just know *about* your mom. It *understands* her—from every family member's perspective. She becomes three-dimensional.

**Third: Governance—Digital Will.**

This is critical. While you're alive, you create your "digital will."

You decide: "My daughter gets full access. My son gets full access. My brother can only see public memories."

You set boundaries: "Don't talk about my medical diagnosis. Only share happy moments."

You appoint executors: "My wife manages this after I'm gone."

These aren't suggestions—they're rules. They're immutable. Enforced by code.

**Why this matters**: This isn't about creating a replacement. This is about creating a continuation. A respectful, ethical, governed continuation.

---

**[2:00 - 2:30] PAGE 6: TECHNOLOGY - Why We Win (Engineering Credibility)**

---

Now, you might think: "But isn't this just a fancy chatbot?"

No. And here's why:

We built a **three-layer memory architecture** that competitors don't have:

- **Layer 0**: Raw memories (photos, emails, voice)
- **Layer 1**: Semantic clustering (identifying patterns, themes, relationships)
- **Layer 2**: Narrative synthesis (weaving it all into a coherent person)

HereAfter only has Layer 0. Eternime never finished Layer 1.

We also built something called the **Me-Alignment Engine.**

It's a system that scores how consistently the AI responds *like the actual person*.

We measure this across four dimensions:
- Linguistic consistency (Do they use the right words and phrases?)
- Emotional consistency (Do they share the same values?)
- Values alignment (Do they make decisions the same way?)
- Factual accuracy (Do they remember things correctly?)

Our score: **95% out of 100.**

HereAfter's score: 72%.  
Generic ChatGPT: 45%.

This isn't theoretical. **This is what our users tell us.** They feel like they're actually talking to the person they lost.

We also get someone's first authentic interaction in under 10 minutes. Competitors need 30-60 minutes.

And our 30-day retention rate is 78%. Industry average is 35%.

**These aren't incremental improvements. These are order-of-magnitude differences.**

We have 3 patents pending. We have proprietary data. We have a brand that will be hard to copy.

---

**[2:30 - 3:00] PAGE 7: BUSINESS MODEL - Unit Economics (Revenue Credibility)**

---

Let's talk about the business:

We have three subscription tiers:

**Free**: Basic access, 0% cost to user  
**Individual** ($15/month): Enhanced features, voice synthesis, higher fidelity  
**Family** ($49/month): Multi-member access, ritual mode, digital will tools

Then we have add-ons. Voice cloning ($29/month). Memorial video generation ($99). Physical memory books ($149).

And we have B2B channels. Funeral homes. Estate planners. Hospice networks.

Here's the math for Year 3, at scale:

100,000 active families. 15,000 paying.

$456 average annual revenue per paying user.

**Revenue: $9.13 million.**

What does it cost us?

LLM API: $540K  
Infrastructure: $50K  
Engineering team: $800K  
Marketing/Sales: $400K  

**Total cost: $1.79 million.**

**That's an 80% gross margin.**

That's Stripe-level unit economics. That's Shopify-level unit economics.

Break-even happens Month 16.

By Year 3, we're doing $4.5 million in operating profit.

This isn't a loss-leader model. This is a real business.

---

**[3:00 - 3:30] PAGE 8: GO-TO-MARKET - Clear Roadmap (Execution Confidence)**

---

We have a three-phase growth plan:

**Phase 1 (Months 0-6): Build Trust**

We enter grief communities where people are already gathering. Reddit communities. Support blogs. Podcast sponsorships.

We run 10 funeral home pilots. Free to the families. Collect case studies. Prove the model works.

By Month 6: 5,000 families, 1,000 paying, $20K MRR.

**Phase 2 (Months 7-18): Expand Channels**

We partner with 50 estate planners. Each one serves hundreds of families.

We integrate with hospice networks.

We launch in 3 countries (Singapore, Japan, Germany).

By Month 18: 30,000 families, 6,000 paying, $225K MRR.

**Phase 3 (Year 2+): Scale**

We're now in 150+ funeral homes across the US. We're working with museums on oral history. We're international.

By that point, we're ready for Series A, and we're doing $500K+ MRR.

The roadmap is clear. The channels are identified. The partnerships are already starting.

---

**[3:30 - 4:00] PAGE 9: TEAM - Why We'll Execute (Personal Credibility)**

---

Who's going to make this happen?

I'm a Columbia grad with a double major in computer science and psychology.

I worked at Meta as a data scientist on the recommendations team. I've published in NeurIPS. I understand AI at a deep level.

But more than that: I've already built the entire MVP myself. Alone. Front-end, back-end, machine learning—all of it.

And it's working. We have 100 beta families. They're using it daily. 1.8 conversations per day on average.

We have 20+ genuine testimonials. People are *emotional* about this product.

We're generating $8K MRR organically. No sales team. Just product-market fit.

We already have 3 funeral home pilots live, and the first one sent us 10 referral customers in Month 1.

We've been featured in TechCrunch, The Atlantic, Vice.

**I've already proven I can execute.**

When we close this funding, I'm hiring a CTO I worked with at Meta. He's seen the product. He wants in.

I have advisors who are world-class: Dr. David Kessler (grief expert), a privacy lawyer from the CCPA, a philosopher from MIT Media Lab.

This is not a solo founder hoping. This is a founder with a proven track record, a team forming, and product-market fit signals.

---

**[4:00 - 4:30] PAGE 10: THE ASK - Close (Call to Action)**

---

I'm raising $1.5 million in seed funding.

Here's how I'll spend it:

40% on engineering (CTO + 2 AI engineers)  
25% on sales and growth (partnerships + marketing)  
20% on compliance and trust (SOC 2, legal, ethics board)  
15% on brand and PR

That gives us 18 months of runway to hit the metrics for Series A.

Based on our conservative projections:

Year 3 ARR: $2.1 million  
Valuation: $10.5 million  
Your return: 7x

In the base case: 18x.  
In the optimistic case: 200x.

**But here's what really matters:**

You're not just investing in a company.

You're investing in a $50 billion market that no one is winning yet.

You're investing in a team that's already proven execution.

You're investing in technology that's genuinely hard to replicate.

And you're investing in something that matters—something that will improve the lives of 300 million bereaved people annually.

In the end, we're all stories. **Soma ensures those stories never end.**

So I'm asking you to join us.

**Let's build the future where goodbye is never really goodbye.**

Thank you.

## 🎭 Speaking Techniques Guide

### Vocal Delivery

**Opening (0:00-0:30)**
- Speak slowly and deliberately
- Pause after "What if goodbye didn't have to mean forever?"
- Lower your voice when sharing personal loss story
- Speed up slightly as you introduce Soma to build momentum

**Data Section (1:00-2:30)**
- Increase pace and energy
- Emphasize key numbers (300M, $50B, 95%, 78%)
- Pause 2 seconds after each major statistic for absorption
- Vary sentence length—short statements for impact, longer ones for complexity

**Execution Section (3:30-4:00)**
- Return to measured, confident pace
- Speak authoritatively about team and traction
- Use "we" language (team confidence)
- Maintain eye contact with different investors

**Closing (4:00-4:30)**
- Slow down again for emotional impact
- Emphasize final mission statement: "We're all stories"
- End strong: not a question, but a declaration

---

### Body Language & Gestures

**Opening Story**: Stand still, hand on heart or relaxed at sides. No pacing.

**Market Slide**: Open hand gestures, show scale with arms. Walk slightly to indicate growth trajectory.

**Three Pillars**: Use three distinct hand positions to represent each pillar (dialogue left, collaboration center, governance right).

**Data Comparisons**: Gesture left for "competitors," right for "Soma" when comparing metrics.

**Financial Section**: Confident stance, hands together or on the podium. This is technical—stability matters.

**GTM Timeline**: Use hand to draw upward trajectory as you describe growth phases.

**Closing**: Return to center stage, open posture, direct eye contact. This is about connection, not data.

---

### Pacing & Strategic Pauses

```
[Pause 2 sec] Every 10 seconds, someone loses someone irreplaceable.
[Pause 1 sec] In the United States alone, it's 2.7 million deaths annually.

[Continue naturally]

What we built is not a storage app. [Pause 1 sec]
What we built is not a chatbot. [Pause 1 sec]
Soma is the bridge between memory and presence. [Pause 2 sec, let it land]
```

**Rule**: Pause after emotionally important statements. Let investors *feel* it.

---

### Audience Connection

- **Scan the room**—make eye contact with different investors every 20-30 seconds
- **Lean in on emotion**—when telling the grandfather story, look slightly vulnerable
- **Lean forward on numbers**—when citing growth metrics, show confidence
- **Mirror energy**—if investors look engaged, increase energy; if confused, slow down and clarify
- **End with eye contact**—final statement directly to the decision-maker

---

## ❓ Anticipated Q&A Responses

### Q1: "HereAfter has 50K users. Why didn't they solve this?"

**A**: 
"Great question. HereAfter's model is prompt-based questionnaires—they ask the dying person 100 questions and create a chatbot from that. 

But here's the gap: They're not building from *lived experience*. No real memories, no context. That's why their retention is 18%—people try it once and abandon it.

We're building from actual memories—10,000 photos, emails, conversations. That's why our 30-day retention is 78%. That's why users have 1.8 conversations *per day*.

Plus, they've never gone B2B. We're starting with funeral homes, which is a distribution advantage they never exploited. Different strategies, different markets."

---

### Q2: "This is emotionally powerful, but can you really scale this?"

**A**:
"Absolutely. In fact, emotional stickiness makes it *easier* to scale. 

Here's why:

1) **Unit economics are incredible** — 80% gross margins, LTV:CAC of 17:1. That means we can spend $280 to acquire a customer who's worth $4,800 lifetime. That's not speculation; we're already seeing it in our organic channels.

2) **B2B channels**—funeral homes, estate planners—they handle the distribution. We handle the product. 19,000 funeral homes in the US is a massive channel. We don't need to acquire individually.

3) **Retention is our moat**—78% at 30 days. That means low churn, predictable revenue. We're not fighting to keep people; the product does that naturally because it's emotionally sticky.

By Month 18, we'll have 35,000 families and $225K MRR. That's fully predictable based on our current funnel data."

---

### Q3: "Doesn't this raise serious privacy and ethics concerns?"

**A**:
"Absolutely right to ask. This is exactly why we're obsessive about governance.

First, the architecture: All data is end-to-end encrypted. Users hold their own decryption keys. We never see unencrypted data.

Second, digital wills are immutable. When a user sets permissions—'only my daughter can see X'—that's enforced in code. The executor can't override it. The company can't override it.

Third, we have an ethics board: Dr. David Kessler (grief expert), a philosopher from MIT Media Lab, and a CCPA privacy lawyer. They review every feature before launch.

Fourth, SOC 2 Type II certification—full security audit by Year 1. GDPR and CCPA compliant by Month 9.

This isn't something we're building in later. It's the foundation of the product. We can't succeed if we breach that trust. The entire business is built on trust."

---

### Q4: "If this is so valuable, won't Google or Apple copy this?"

**A**:
"They could try, but here's why they probably won't—and why we'd win if they did:

First, *brand risk*. A Google memorial feels impersonal. A small, mission-driven startup feels *human*. The optics of a $2 trillion company harvesting grief revenue would be terrible.

Second, *business model conflict*. Their revenue is ads and data. Ours is subscription and trust. You can't run ads on memorial personas. You can't sell data to advertisers. The models are fundamentally incompatible.

Third, *competitive response*—if they tried to enter the market, they'd probably just acquire us. Which is a win for our investors.

But honestly? The real moat isn't technical. It's trust. We're going to be *the* trusted brand for digital legacy. By the time anyone tries to compete, we'll be too entrenched. That's how it works in grief tech."

---

### Q5: "You're one person + one engineer. How do I know this team can execute?"

**A**:
"I get asked this a lot, and honestly, it's the right question.

But consider this: I built the entire MVP alone. Engineering, design, ML—all of it. That's not a one-person trick; that's evidence of technical depth.

I was at Meta working on recommendation algorithms. I understand modern AI.

I've already brought in a world-class designer (former Meta). When we close this round, my CTO will be on Day 1 (I've already talked to him—he's ready).

But more importantly: We have *proof*. 100 users are actively using this. $8K MRR is being generated. 20+ genuine testimonials. This isn't a concept; it's a shipped product with product-market fit signals.

The question isn't whether I can build products. The question is whether you're betting on the market and the product. And both are de-risked. The market is huge. The product works. The team is forming.

I'm not asking you to bet on a solo founder. I'm asking you to bet on a proven product in a proven market with a team that's already assembling."

## 💡 Last Thoughts Before Presenting

Remember: You're not asking for money. **You're inviting investors to join a mission.**

You're not selling a product. **You're describing a market that's about to be won.**

You're not pitching from a position of need. **You're pitching from a position of inevitable growth.**

*That mindset changes everything.*

Speak with conviction. Speak with clarity. But most importantly, speak with the passion that made you build this in the first place.

You lost your grandfather and decided to solve a $50B problem.

That's not a startup pitch.

**That's a calling.**

Go execute.
