### Footer Information
- **Founder**: Patrick Ma  
- **Seeking**: $1.5M Seed Round  
- **Mission**: Engineering Eternity

### Design Guidance
- **Background**: Warm gradient (soft gray-blue → deep blue), family photo fade-out on right
- **Tone**: Emotional connection, not cold technology
- **Typography**: Sans-serif, clean (Helvetica Neue or Inter)
- **Emotional Focus**: "This is love extended, not data preservation"

# PAGE 2: The Problem

## 🎯 The Universal Pain

### Opening Data
**Every 10 seconds, globally, one person loses someone irreplaceable**
- Annual global deaths: **60+ million**
- Directly affected individuals: **300 million people/year** (5 family members per loss)
- US annual deaths: **2.7 million**

### Three-Layer Problem Structure

| Layer | Phenomenon | Pain Point |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **Emotional** | Losing the closest person | Nowhere to place grief |
| **Practical** | 10K+ photos piling up | Memories turned into data |
| **Social** | Silent expectations | No one to talk to about it |

### Current Solutions Fail

**Why traditional approaches don't work**:
- 🪦 **Gravestones/urns**: Mark *absence*, not interactive
- 💬 **Generic AI chatbots**: Complete strangers, no personality, cold
- 📸 **Photo galleries**: Static, soulless data
- 👨‍⚕️ **Therapy**: $150/session, hard to access, can't recreate connection

### Real User Pain

> *"I just want to ask Dad one more question."*  
> *"I wish my daughter could know her grandmother's stories."*  
> *"I'm forgetting the sound of his laugh."*

### The Insight
**Memory becomes data. Connection becomes loss. Legacy fades into silence.**

*There's a $50B market for the solution.*

### Design Guidance
- **Visuals**: Show "absence"—empty chair, static photos fading
- **Data viz**: Global map with red pulses (death statistics)
- **Emotional contrast**: Cold gravestones → warm conversation bubbles
- **Tone**: Empathetic, validating the pain, building hope

# PAGE 4: The Solution - Three Pillars

## 🌟 Soma: The Three-Dimensional Connection

### Value Proposition
```
Memory Data + Family Context + AI Engine = Digital Presence
```

### Pillar 1️⃣: Dialogue (Authentic Conversation)
- 📱 **Natural conversation** in their authentic voice (95%+ linguistic fidelity)
- 🎯 **Zero-hallucination design** — every response cites source memories
- 💭 **True understanding** — remembers who you are, your relationship
- ⏰ **Ritual moments** — automated birthday messages, anniversaries, holidays
- **Why it matters**: You're not talking to an AI. You're continuing a conversation.

### Pillar 2️⃣: Collaboration (Family Co-Creation)
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Family uploads** — siblings add different memory sets (photos, recordings, letters)
- 🧩 **Memory graph strengthens** — each family member's perspective creates richer persona
- 🎛️ **Shared governance** — transparent permissions, who sees what
- 📊 **Unified timeline** — all contributions visible, celebrated
- **Why it matters**: One person's memories are incomplete. Five family members create completeness.

### Pillar 3️⃣ : Governance (Digital Will)
- 📝 **Living users create "digital wills"** — set access rules while alive
- 🔐 **Consent-based design** — who gets access, when, to what
- ⚖️ **Executor management** — designate trusted people to manage legacy
- ✋ **Immutable audit log** — every interaction tracked
- 🛡️ **Ethical boundaries** — system ensures no abuse
- **Why it matters**: This is sacred. Only built by people who understand grief.

### Product Flow

```
1️⃣ Upload      →  2️⃣ Learn      →  3️⃣ Interact   →  4️⃣ Collaborate →  5️⃣ Preserve

# PAGE 5: Product Experience Demo

## 💬 Core Interaction Moments

### Scenario 1: The Power of Conversation

**User asks:**
> "Mom, what was your favorite meal I ever made?"

**Soma (as Mom) responds:**
> "Your homemade pasta! 🍝 Remember your birthday last September? You spent the whole afternoon making it from scratch. I told you 'This tastes like home.' That was one of the happiest days this past year, sweetheart."

**Built-in citations:**
- 📎 Memory #1234 (2023-09-15): "Made pasta for mom's birthday"
- 📎 Memory #5678 (2023-09-15): Voice memo - "This tastes like home"
- 🎯 Relationship tag: You as "caring daughter"

**Why this works**: It's not generic. It's personal. It's real. It cites sources.

---

### Scenario 2: Ritual Mode - Birthday Surprise

**Auto-triggered on birthday**
```
Today is your birthday.

I wish I could be there to celebrate with you.
But I want you to know: you're always in my heart.

Do you remember that special birthday at the beach?
You smiled so big when we watched the sunset together.

I'm proud of you.
Always.

— Dad 💌
```

**Features demonstrated**:
- Proactive, contextual
- Emotional, not clinical
- Personalized to your relationship
- Perfect for vulnerable moments

---

### Scenario 3: Family Collaboration

**Memory convergence**:
- 📸 Sister uploads: Mom's cooking videos collection
- 📝 Brother uploads: 2019 saved voicemails
- 📖 Dad uploads: 40 years of family photos

**Result**: Persona persona grows from "85% complete" → "98% complete"
- Richer dialogue about cooking + family recipes
- Captures mom's voice and laugh
- Captures life evolution across decades
- Multi-generational perspectives

**Timeline view**: All family members' contributions visible, celebrated

---

### Scenario 4: Digital Will in Action

**User portal preview**:
```
📋 My Digital Will

1. Access Permissions
   ✓ My daughter: Full access
   ✓ My son: Full access
   □ My brother: Public memories only

2. Content Boundaries
   □ Don't discuss: Medical details
   ✓ Only share: Happy memories
   ✓ Special dates: Birthdays, anniversaries

3. Executor Assignment
   → My wife (Primary executor)
   → My attorney (Backup)

4. Preservation Timeline
   → 100 years after my death (changeable anytime)
```

**Why it matters**: Total user control. Peace of mind. Ethical clarity.

```

**How it works**:
- RLHF (Reinforcement Learning): User's 5-star ratings → continuous optimization
- Family feedback loop: Siblings say "inaccurate" → system adjusts weights
- Iterative refinement: Each conversation makes the persona sharper

---

### B2B Channels (15-20% revenue growth)

#### Channel 1: Funeral Homes (Beachhead)
- **Model**: Revenue share (Soma 40% / funeral home 60%)
- **Pricing**: $299/family (funeral home charges customer)
- **Scale**: 19K funeral homes in US × 100 new families/year
- **Potential market**: $571M total (40% of transaction)
- **GTM**: 10 pilot homes (0-6mo) → 50 homes (7-18mo)

#### Channel 2: Estate Planners
- **Model**: Per-client licensing ($50-200/client)
- **Positioning**: "Add-on service" bundled with their planning
- **Scale**: 68M Americans with estate plans × 25% tech-comfortable = 17M TAM
- **Expected attach**: 3-5% = 510K-850K potential users

#### Channel 3: Healthcare Institutions
- **Model**: Institutional licensing ($100K+/year)
- **Use cases**: Hospice, geriatric care, end-of-life planning
- **Scale**: 4.3K hospice providers × 1,500 patients/year

---

### Unit Economics (Year 3 at Scale)

**Assumptions**:
- 100K active families (15K paying)
- 15% free-to-premium conversion
- $456/year blended ARPU (subscriptions + add-ons)

**Revenue Calculation**:
```
B2C Subscriptions:
  15K paying families × $456/year = $6.84M

B2C Add-ons (40% attach rate):
  15K × 0.4 × $75 avg = $450K

B2B Channels:
  Funeral homes (50 homes × 15 families × $299 × 40%) = $90K
  Estate planners (500 partners × 5 clients × $100) = $250K
  Healthcare (10 institutions × $150K) = $1.5M

Total Revenue: $9.13M ARR
```

**Cost Structure**:
```
LLM API: $3/user/mo × 15K × 12 = $540K
Infrastructure: Supabase + CDN = $50K
Engineering team (3): $800K
Marketing/Sales: $400K

Total COGS + OpEx: $1.79M

Gross Profit: ($9.13M - $1.79M) / $9.13M = 80.4%
```

**Key metric**: >80% gross margin = SaaS unit economics
**Net margin Year 3**: ~50% ($4.5M operating profit)

---

### Revenue Trajectory

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Total families** | 5,000 | 30,000 | 100,000 |

### Why This Investment Makes Sense

#### 1. **Leadership Position in Emerging Market**
The grief/legacy tech market is $50B globally. The first company to achieve scale + trust will have monopolistic advantages. You're betting on the category winner.

#### 2. **Aligned Social Impact**
This isn't just financial. You're investing in technology that improves the lives of 300M bereaved people annually. Purpose-driven returns.

#### 3. **Defensible Business Model**
- Sticky users (emotional, not functional switching)
- LTV:CAC > 10:1 (very efficient growth)
- High gross margins (>80%)
- Multiple revenue streams (B2C + B2B)

#### 4. **Proven Execution Path**
- Product already exists (MVP shipped)
- Product-market fit signals (78% retention, $8K MRR organic)
- Team has AI expertise (not just grief expertise)
- Clear 18-month roadmap to Series A

#### 5. **Exit Optionality**
- **Strategic buyers**: Google (Memento), Apple (Photos), Amazon (digital legacy), major funeral home chains
- **IPO path**: Once profitability achieved (Month 16)
- **Secondary market**: If not exiting, strong dividend potential (>50% margins)
