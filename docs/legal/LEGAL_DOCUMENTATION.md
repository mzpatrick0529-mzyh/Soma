## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Mitigation Strategies

### 1. **WeChat Data Decryption Risk**
**Issue:** Potential CFAA violation; WeChat ToS breach  
**Mitigation:**
- User-provided decryption key (not stored by Soma)
- Disclaimer: "User assumes responsibility for platform ToS compliance"
- Alternative: Pursue official WeChat data export API partnership

### 2. **AI Training Data Copyright**
**Issue:** Fair Use defense uncertain for commercial AI training  
**Mitigation:**
- User-specific models only (no shared training)
- Opt-in consent for any aggregate model training
- No public web scraping for training data
- User Content License limited to service provision

### 3. **Biometric Privacy (BIPA)**
**Issue:** Voice embeddings and facial vectors may qualify as biometric identifiers  
**Mitigation:**
- Written consent from Illinois residents before collection
- Clear retention and destruction policy (account termination + 30 days)
- No sale or disclosure of biometric data
- Geofence IL users for additional consent flow

### 4. **Sensitive Personal Information (SPI)**
**Issue:** High percentage of SPI collected (health, geolocation, biometric)  
**Mitigation:**
- CPRA ¬ß 1798.121 compliance: Limited use commitment
- "Limit Use of SPI" opt-out mechanism
- No use for marketing, advertising, or profiling without opt-in
- Data minimization: Collect only what's necessary

### 5. **AI-Generated Content Liability**
**Issue:** AI may produce inaccurate, biased, or harmful content  
**Mitigation:**
- Clear disclaimers: NOT for medical, legal, or financial advice
- Beta version warnings
- User responsibility for AI output usage
- RLHF feedback loop for quality improvement
- Content moderation for harmful outputs
