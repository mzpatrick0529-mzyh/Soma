# Soma

Soma is an emotionally interactive digital memory platform that creates personalized AI avatars through multimodal data aggregation and fine-tuning.

## Overview

Soma aggregates users' multimodal digital footprints (chat histories, audio/video, social media) to fine-tune open-source models, creating AI avatars that authentically replicate behavioral styles and proactive expression. Users interact through text and voice conversations, video sharing, and blog postsâ€”the avatar initiates greetings in familiar tones, shares "updates," and sustains emotional bonds.

## Features

### ðŸ¤– AI Avatar Creation
- **Behavioral Replication**: Authentically replicates user communication styles and patterns
- **Personality Modeling**: Learns from chat histories, social media, and interactions
- **Emotional Bonding**: Tracks and maintains relationship strength over time

### ðŸ’¬ Multimodal Interaction
- **Text Conversations**: Natural text-based chat with personalized responses
- **Voice Conversations**: Audio input processing with speech synthesis
- **Video Sharing**: Upload, share, and analyze video content
- **Blog System**: Create and share posts from both user and avatar perspectives

### ðŸŽ¯ Proactive Expression
- **Automated Greetings**: Context-aware greetings at different times of day
- **Check-ins**: Regular engagement to maintain emotional bonds
- **Memory Sharing**: References past interactions to strengthen connections
- **Milestone Celebrations**: Recognizes and celebrates relationship milestones

### ðŸ“Š Data Aggregation
- **Chat Histories**: Import and analyze text conversations
- **Audio/Video Files**: Process multimodal content
- **Social Media**: Aggregate posts and interactions from various platforms

### ðŸ§  Model Fine-Tuning
- **Custom Training**: Fine-tune open-source models on user data
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Learn communication styles and preferences
- **Continuous Learning**: Adapt based on ongoing interactions

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mzpatrick0529-mzyh/Soma.git
cd Soma
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install the package:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```python
from soma import AvatarEngine, TextConversation, DataAggregator, ModelTrainer

# 1. Aggregate user data
aggregator = DataAggregator("user_001")
aggregator.add_chat_history([
    {"content": "Hey, how are you?", "timestamp": "2024-01-01T10:00:00"}
])

# 2. Train the avatar model
trainer = ModelTrainer("user_001")
trainer.prepare_training_data(aggregator.get_aggregated_data())
trainer.load_base_model()

# 3. Create the avatar
avatar = AvatarEngine("user_001", avatar_name="MyAvatar")
avatar.initialize_personality(aggregator.get_aggregated_data())

# 4. Start conversing
conversation = TextConversation(avatar, "user_001")
response = conversation.send_message("Hello!")
print(response)
```

## Usage Examples

### Data Aggregation

```python
from soma import DataAggregator

# Initialize aggregator
aggregator = DataAggregator("user_001")

# Add chat histories
aggregator.add_chat_history([
    {"content": "Hello!", "timestamp": "2024-01-01T10:00:00"}
])

# Add social media data
aggregator.add_social_media_data("twitter", [
    {"text": "Great day today!", "timestamp": "2024-01-01"}
])

# Save aggregated data
aggregator.save_aggregated_data()
```

### Avatar Conversations

```python
from soma import AvatarEngine, TextConversation

# Create avatar
avatar = AvatarEngine("user_001", avatar_name="MyAvatar")

# Text conversation
text_chat = TextConversation(avatar, "user_001")
response = text_chat.send_message("How are you?")

# Voice conversation
from soma.conversation.voice_interface import VoiceConversation
voice_chat = VoiceConversation(avatar, "user_001")
result = voice_chat.process_audio_input("audio.wav")
```

### Proactive Engagement

```python
from soma.proactive_engagement.engagement_manager import ProactiveEngagement

engagement = ProactiveEngagement(avatar, "user_001")

# Schedule greetings
engagement.schedule_greeting("morning")

# Send updates
engagement.send_update("recent developments")

# Check in with user
engagement.check_in()
```

### Blog Management

```python
from soma.blog.blog_manager import BlogManager

blog = BlogManager("user_001", avatar)

# User creates a post
blog.create_post(
    title="My Journey",
    content="Today I started...",
    author="user"
)

# Avatar generates a post
blog.generate_avatar_post("friendship")
```

### Video Sharing

```python
from soma.media.video_manager import VideoManager

video_mgr = VideoManager("user_001")

# Upload video
video_info = video_mgr.upload_video("video.mp4")

# Share with others
video_mgr.share_video(video_info["video_id"], ["user_002", "user_003"])
```
